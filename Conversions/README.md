# Coordinate and Vector Classes

## Coordinate Class

A class named `Coordinate` with the following properties:

- `X` (double): Represents the x-coordinate of a point.
- `Y` (double): Represents the y-coordinate of a point.

## Vector Class

A class named `Vector` with the following properties:

- `X` (double): Represents the x-component of a vector.
- `Y` (double): Represents the y-component of a vector.

## Custom Type Conversions

- An implicit conversion operator in the `Coordinate` class to allow conversion to a `Vector`.
- An explicit conversion operator in the `Vector` class to allow conversion to a `Coordinate`.
